[Rules]

# 28 cards on the tableau at the beginning of play in the following order: Stack 1: 1 card, Stack 2: 2 cards, Stack 3: 3 cards, Stack 4: 4 cards, Stack 5: 5 cards, Stack 6: 6 cards, Stack 7: 7 cards
# 24 cards in the Stock Pile
# Only King cards (value 13) may be moved onto empty tableau Stacks
# Aces move directly to Foundation Piles
# One Ace per Foundation Pile
# Cards visually stack only on the 7 tableau Stacks
# Cards will visually stack in descending order with alternating suits
# The Stock Pile does not receive new cards
# User clicks through the Stock Pile until they select a playable card
# The Stock Pile gets cycled through by the user until there are 1, or less, cards available
# When the Stock Pile is empty, clicking it recycles all waste cards back into the stock pile and does not shuffle
# A 'full' Stack is a single stack with 1 of the following: King, Queen, Jack, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, A in alternating suits
# A 'full' Stack is the only permitted object on a Foundation Pile
# As the user cycles through the Stock Pile, each card not selected is skipped until the user cycles back to it through the Pile
# A 'full' Stack must be clicked by the user to go to the foundation pile
# Only face-up cards are in play
# The top layer of cards on the tableau are face-up. All other cards on the tableau are on standby
# After each face-up card is selected, the first card underneath it flips and becomes face-up (and in play)
# After the first Ace of a suit is on the Foundation Pile, cards in ascending order of the same suit can be added on top of it (non-visual stacking)
# The user loses points every time the Stock Pile recycles
# The user gains points every time a card is Stacked
# The user wins by moving every card onto the tableau
# An 'undo' button is necessary
